- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kappanjoe!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in changing careers to be an app/software developer.
- ðŸŒ± My current focus is on learning Swift/SwiftUI, JavaScript/TypeScript, & Python. I'm also enrolled in a Part-Time Immersive programming bootcamp with [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io) starting in January 2023.
