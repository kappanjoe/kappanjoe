### Hi! I’m kappanjoe.

I love anything process-oriented, like handmade bookmaking and letterpress, translation from Japanese to English, and full-stack programming.

Foremost, I’m a Software Engineer looking for new opportunities to work on something new and exciting, especially anything that has diversity, inclusion, and/or economic or ecological sustainability in mind. I love working with Swift and TypeScript, and I'm eager to learn more about Ruby. Please feel free to connect with me if you are interested in working together!
